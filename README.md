**Please note:** If the app doesn't work for you, don't hesitate to open an issue [here](https://github.com/cgrossde/Pullover/issues). I usually test Pullover on Mac and Windows before publishing a new version, however if I miss something just contact me. Please add the log file (see section *Bugs* bellow).

## Build your own
You can create builds for all platforms with Mac OS, take a look at [CROSSPLATFORM.md](CROSSPLATFORM.md) to find out about necessary dependencies.

1. Install build dependencies: `npm install`
2. Install dependencies of Pullover: `cd src && npm install`
3. Compile src with webpack: `npm run compile`
4. Return to root dir: `cd ..`
5. Rename `config/buildConf.json.sample` to `config/buildConf.json`
6. Open `config/buildConf.json` and adapt `platforms:` to your preference
7. Build binaries with: `./builder build`
8. If the build process was successful, you can find the binaries in `bin/pullover/[platform]`
9. If you want to package them (`.zip`/`.dmg`/`.exe`), execute `./builder createDist`
10. The distributables will be placed in `bin/deploy`

### Development

There is no need to always build packaged binaries if you want to dive into the source of Pullover and try out some changes. Instead install the node dependencies in the root folder and in source with `npm install` and run the `builder` script. Make sure to copy `config/buildConf.json.sample` to `config/buildConf.json` first

```Shell
cp config/buildConf.json.sample config/buildConf.json
    npm install
    cd src && npm install
npm run watch
    # In another shell go back to Pullovers root folder and run the app
    cd ..
    ./builder run
```

### Bugs

If you encounter a bug or Pullover crashes, please go to the following directory and send me the `pullover.1.log` file by opening an issue:

* OS X - `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Pullover`
* Windows 8 - `C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Pullover`
* Windows XP - `C:\Documents and Settings\YOURUSERNAME\Application Data\Pullover`
* Linux - `$XDG_DATA_HOME/Pullover or $HOME/.local/share/Pullover`

## Contributing

If you miss a feature or fixed a bug, don't hesitate to create a pull-request. I open-sourced this App with the hope that others contribute to it. Especially for Windows and Linux since I rarely use those systems.

**0.0.1** - **0.3.2** Initial app, based on jQuery but kind of messy

## Why was this App created?

I discovered Pushover in mid November 2014 and was really excited. The only thing missing was a decent desktop client. At the time there was only a rudimentary Notification Center integration for Mac. But I was missing the following features:

* Show the icon of the notifying app (it always showed the pushover icon)
* Make the notification clickable to open URLs attached to notifications
* Support for Windows or Linux

Since then a lot has changed. The initial app was written because I wanted to try `nwjs` and fix the problems mentioned before. I used jQuery at the time and it got kind of messy and unpredictable. In 2015 I wanted to do something with React and did a complete rewrite (with a lot of breaks in between). The first beta after the rewrite was released in Feb. 2016. The code is a lot better to maintain now and new features should be easy to implement.
